        <h1>We are more than 350 people from 30 different<br> countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin<br> and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h1>
        <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and <br> Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional<br> backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are <br> somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has<br> the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future<br>of music culture.
